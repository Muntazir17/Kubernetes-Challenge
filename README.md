# [The Kubernetes Ecommerce Site Challenge](your-project-link)

## Project Summary

Deploying modern web applications presents challenges such as scalability, consistency, and availability. This project, "[The Kubernetes Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/extensions/kubernetes-challenge/)," tackled these issues by leveraging Docker and Kubernetes to deliver a scalable, consistent, and resilient deployment strategy.

## Key Achievements

- **Containerization:** Successfully containerized an e-commerce web application and database using Docker, ensuring a consistent runtime environment.
- **Kubernetes Deployment:** Deployed the application on a Kubernetes cluster across AWS, demonstrating advanced Kubernetes skills.
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Implemented Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to handle varying traffic loads.
- **Zero-Downtime Updates:** Performed rolling updates and rollbacks to ensure application availability during updates.

- **Configuration Management:** Utilized ConfigMaps and Secrets for secure and flexible configuration management.
- **Liveness and Readiness Probes:** Configured liveness and readiness probes to monitor application health and ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Set up automated build and deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions to streamline updates and deployments.

## Steps to Implement

1. **Certification**
   - Complete the Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) course by KodeKloud for foundational Kubernetes knowledge.

2. **Containerize Your Application**
   - **Web Application:** Create a Dockerfile, build and push the Docker image.
   - **Database:** Use the official MariaDB image and prepare database initialization scripts.

3. **Set Up Kubernetes**
   - Create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS (EKS).

4. **Deploy Your Website**
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for deploying the web application and database.

5. **Expose Your Website**
   - Define a LoadBalancer Service to expose the application.

6. **Configuration Management**
   - Add and deploy a feature toggle using ConfigMaps.

7. **Scale Your Application**
   - Scale up the application to handle increased traffic.

8. **Perform a Rolling Update**
   - Update the application with a new version and ensure zero downtime.

9. **Roll Back a Deployment**
   - Revert to a previous deployment state if necessary.

10. **Autoscale Your Application**
    - Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to manage resource scaling automatically.

11. **Implement Liveness and Readiness Probes**
    - Add probes to ensure the applicationâ€™s health and readiness.

12. **Utilize ConfigMaps and Secrets**
    - Securely manage configuration and sensitive data.

13. **Package Everything in Helm:** 
    - Create a Helm chart for easier deployment and management.

14. **Implement Persistent Storage:** 
    - Use PersistentVolumeClaim for MariaDB data.

15. **Implement Basic CI/CD Pipeline:** 
    - Automate the build and deployment process with GitHub Actions.
